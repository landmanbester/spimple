        info: Measurement sets used to make the image. Used to get paralactic angles
          if doing primary beam correction.

      beam_model:
        info: Fits beam model to use. It is assumed that the pattern is path_to_beam/name_corr_re/im.fits.
          Provide only the path up to name e.g. /home/user/beams/meerkat_lband. Patterns
          matching corr are determined automatically. Only real and imaginary beam
          models currently supported.
